## About The Project 

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 
Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development. Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel.
